pseudo because in actual raytracing, rays are cast from the observer (target) and traced wrt source (sun)
here im doing it the way how real life works; (sun) to (target)
also im using bevy cause i just wanted a rendering pipeline tried to minimize the usage of actual bevy features
didnt use any raycasting, purely math
