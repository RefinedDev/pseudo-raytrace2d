pseudo because in actual raytracing, rays are cast from the observer (target) and traced wrt source (sun)<br>
here im doing it the way how real life works; (sun) to (target)<br>
also im using bevy cause i just wanted a rendering pipeline tried to minimize the usage of actual bevy features<br>
didnt use any raycasting, purely math<br>
