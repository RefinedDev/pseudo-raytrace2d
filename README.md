pseudo because in actual raytracing, rays are cast from the observer (target) and traced wrt source (sun)\n
here im doing it the way how real life works; (sun) to (target)\n
also im using bevy cause i just wanted a rendering pipeline tried to minimize the usage of actual bevy features\n
didnt use any raycasting, purely math\n
